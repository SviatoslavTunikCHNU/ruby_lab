  saw it the   flicker of a ghost\r\n  Dm            G               Am\r\nA shadow
  of the fear inside my bones\r\n  Dm       G                 Am\r\nI wrote it yeah
  I wrote the story of our love\r\n    Dm               G               Am\r\nBut
  sometimes, honey stories aren`t enough\r\n\r\n[Chorus]:\r\n                     Dm
  \      G      Am\r\nIt might have been a dream so bright naive\r\n                     Dm
  \       G   Am\r\nIt might have been a dream but I belived\r\n                  Dm
  \        G        Am\r\nI`m following the waves they rise and break\r\n                     Dm

  \             G                      Am\r\nThe one where you explained that you
  had to go\r\n    Dm      G                       Am\r\nBut what if   we met at a
  different time, time, time\r\nDm            G                   Am\r\nAfter we both
  learned to walk the line\r\n\r\n[Chorus]:\r\n                     Dm       G      Am\r\nIt
  might have been a dream so bright naive\r\n                     Dm        G   Am\r\nIt
